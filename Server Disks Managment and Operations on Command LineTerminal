df -h
What it does: Displays disk usage for all mounted filesystems in a human-readable format (e.g., GB/MB).
Why it's used: To quickly identify which partitions are full or have free space.

du -sh *
What it does: Shows the size of each file and directory in the current location, summarized in a readable format.
Why it's used: To find which items are consuming the most space in the current directory.

du -h --max-depth=1 /
What it does: Displays disk usage for each top-level directory under / with human-readable sizes.
Why it's used: To identify which major system directories are using the most space.

lsblk
What it does: Lists all block devices (disks and partitions) and their layout.
Why it's used: To view disk structure and confirm device/partition names before modifying them.

growpart /dev/nvme0n1 2
What it does: Expands partition 2 on disk /dev/nvme0n1 to use all available unallocated space.
Why it's used: When disk size is increased (e.g., cloud/VM), this adjusts the partition to match.

xfs_growfs -d /
What it does: Grows the XFS filesystem mounted at / to occupy the newly available space in the partition.
Why it's used: Needed after resizing the partition to allow the OS to actually use the extra space.

mount
What it does: Lists all currently mounted filesystems and their mount points.
Why it's used: To verify if and where filesystems are mounted, and check their types.


Notes::
- Always confirm your working directory with `pwd` before using deletion commands like `rm -rf *`.
- Double-check disk and partition names with `lsblk` before applying changes.
- `xfs_growfs` is specific to XFS; for `ext4` filesystems, use `resize2fs` instead.
- Be cautious â€” most of these commands affect system storage directly and should be executed with proper backups or snapshots in place.
